# Roadmap

Phases are built in order. A phase is done only when implementation, UI, API,
tests, error states, lint, type checks and documentation are all in place.

| Phase | Scope | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Project foundation: structure, config, health check, homepage, docs | ✅ Complete |
| 1 | Audio upload: UI, endpoint, validation, storage, metadata | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Pitch engine: preprocessing, detection, confidence filter, Hz→MIDI→note→cents | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | Analysis dashboard: summary cards, range, accuracy, pitch timeline, note distribution | ✅ Complete |
| 4 | Microphone recording in the browser | ✅ Complete |
| 5 | Advanced metrics: RMS, peak, spectral features | ✅ Complete |
| 6 | Claude integration: structured payload, service, feedback UI | ✅ Complete |
| 7 | User history: users, recordings, analyses, comparison, progress chart | ✅ Complete |
| 8 | Song analyser: key, BPM, melody/range estimation, limitations messaging | Planned |
| 9 | Song compatibility: range overlap, difficulty, transpose suggestions | Planned |
| 10 | Production polish: auth, security hardening, error pages, performance, deployment | Started — identity portability and deletion (7P) |

## Phase 0 — delivered

- Monorepo layout: `frontend/`, `backend/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`
- FastAPI app factory, CORS, JSON structured logging, cached env-backed settings
- `GET /health` and `GET /api/v1/health`
- Next.js 16 App Router homepage, dark-first theme tokens, typed API client,
  live API status indicator
- `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, Dockerfiles, `docker-compose.yml`
- Backend: 6 pytest tests, ruff (lint + format), mypy strict
- Frontend: eslint, `tsc --noEmit`, production build
- `scripts/check.sh` runs every check
- Documentation: architecture, API, audio analysis, AI layer, limitations

Deliberately **not** in Phase 0: any audio handling, database models or LLM
calls. Dependencies for those land with the phase that uses them.

## Phase 1 — definition of done

A user can upload a valid audio file and see its filename, duration, file size
and an audio player. Invalid files (wrong type, too large, too long, corrupted)
fail with a clear message driven by the documented error codes.

## Phase 7 — where it stands

Built through Step 7M:

- Upload, validation, storage and metadata (7A)
- Provider protocols and the mock adapters behind them (7B)
- Deepgram and Claude adapters, selected by configuration (7C–7D)
- Speech analysis: transcript, metrics, feedback, background execution (7E)
- The analysis experience in the browser (7F)
- Microphone recording, WAV encoding, explicit upload (7G–7H)
- Live pitch detection in the browser, and Live Vocal Practice (7H, 7J)
- Deterministic backend audio analysis: pitch, range, stability, loudness,
  spectrum (7I)
- Note breakdown from the stored pitch timeline (7K)
- AI interpretation of the audio measurements (7L)
- PostgreSQL as the source of truth, anonymous owners, recording history (7M)
- Recording comparison: two owned recordings side by side, with deterministic
  deltas, explicit units and measurable condition caveats (7N)
- Progress tracking: an owner's measurements over time, with per-point
  measured/unmeasured/ineligible states, an accessible chart and table, and no
  trend line (7O)

Phase 7 is complete. What it deliberately does **not** contain, in any of its
three user-facing features:

- an overall figure, a level, a grade or a ranking — no type in the system has a
  field that could hold one;
- a claim that anyone's singing improved;
- an AI judgement of comparison or progress. Both are deterministic arithmetic
  over stored measurements, and neither service takes a provider.

Four of the seven measurements have no desirable direction, and the three that
do are defined against equal temperament rather than against singing. See
[api.md](api.md) and [limitations.md](limitations.md).

**Phase 8 has not started.** Nothing about song analysis, key, BPM, melody
extraction or transposition exists — verified by search, not assumed.

## Phase 10 — where it stands

Step 7P audited the whole repository before choosing what to build next, and
chose Phase 10 over Phase 8 on the evidence: 14 of 16 endpoints were gated on a
bearer key with **no** way to see it, move it, or delete what it owned, and
Phase 8 would have increased the value sitting behind that key.

Delivered in 7P:

- `GET /api/v1/identity` — what this key holds, in counts
- `DELETE /api/v1/identity` — remove every recording, analysis and stored audio
  file, irreversibly
- The recovery key shown in the browser, so it can be saved and pasted on
  another device — the server stores only a hash and cannot replace it
- `IdentityResolver`, the documented seam where a real authentication provider
  will resolve to the **existing** `owner_id`

**Not yet built** in Phase 10: real credentials (email, password, sessions),
rate limiting, error pages, and deployment hardening. Credentials need a way to
prove you are an existing anonymous owner — which is exactly the portable key
7P delivers — so this was the first step rather than a substitute for it.
